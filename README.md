# UG-PG-Internship-Automation

This project automates the management and approval process of student internships using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It provides a user-friendly portal for students to submit internship details and required documents. Faculty and administrators can review, approve, or reject applications with real-time updates.
